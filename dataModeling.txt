// Everything in English
// For card game terms, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_card_game_terms
// => One Game consists of several Deals where Players use all their cards during successive Rounds 



// IMHO better to use just int number to reference cards in all messages
// and have a "cards description" hash with the complementary info(malus,...) when needed
// reason 1: information about cards is not changing during game
// reason 2: we cannot accept malus info from client because of tampering risk
// reason 3: simpler event data
